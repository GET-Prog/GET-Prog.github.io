**Hello World**. A great way to start a project, isn't it?

This is the first post on this blog and will help us to see how things will go.

That's it for today, and for now, how about looking at another initial post from a famous blog?
[The Arrives Blog from The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2008-02-22-the-blog-arrives/).

*So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish* :fish:
